  This project builds a movie recommendation system using Deep Learning, Sentiment Analysis, and SVD to analyze user reviews. The process begins with web scraping from IMDb and TMDb, followed by data preprocessing to clean and standardize the collected information. Next, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is conducted to uncover patterns and trends within the data.
  For modeling, sentiment classification using NLP is performed to capture user emotions from reviews, employing LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks for deeper contextual understanding. Additionally, SVD (Singular Value Decomposition) is used for matrix factorization to uncover latent user preferences. This combined approach suggests movies based on both emotions and underlying preferences, enhancing personalization beyond simple ratings and leading to greater user satisfaction.
